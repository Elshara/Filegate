# Filegate

Filegate is a profile-centred social application designed for shared hosting. Every asset is organised beneath the `/assets` tree so you can drop the project straight into `public_html` (or any web root) and start collaborating.

## Key principles

- **Flat-file persistence** – Users, posts, and settings are stored as JSON documents under `assets/json/dynamic`, keeping deployment portable and backup-friendly.
- **Asset classification** – A manifest in `assets/json/static/datasets.json` labels each dataset as `static` or `dynamic` so the platform can route reads and writes to the correct store automatically.
- **Function-per-file PHP** – Each reusable routine lives in its own PHP file under `assets/php/{global|pages}` so pages load only the logic they need.
- **Localized presentation** – Shared styles live in `assets/css`, while each page controller builds its markup on demand to keep the runtime light.
- **Delegated configuration** – Administrators can rename the network, expose or lock individual settings, and even swap out entire datasets without touching the filesystem.
- **HTML5-native content** – Profiles and posts accept a wide range of HTML5 elements, allowing creators to publish rich articles, galleries, conversations, or custom post types.
- **Attachment-friendly composer** – Members can upload files directly into `/assets/uploads/<extension>` with local previews and secure delivery via `media.php`.
- **Rich notifications** – Post activity queues email, browser, cookie, and file-cache notifications driven by JSON and XML templates with admin-controlled channels.

> **Note:** The PHP files always reference the canonical copies under `assets/`. During bootstrap the `fg_sync_public_assets()` helper reads `assets/json/static/asset_mirrors.json` and refreshes the corresponding files under `public/assets/` so shared hosts can serve them without manual copies. Extend that dataset when you introduce new static helpers and the sync step will publish them automatically.

The JavaScript helpers under `assets/js/global` follow the same mirroring pattern. Each file exposes a single function (for example `fg_registerPostPreview`) so that pages can load only the behaviours they need. The mirrored copies in `public/assets/js/global` are generated by the same helper and are served to the browser.

## First run

1. Upload the repository to your web root so `/assets` and the PHP entrypoints share the same directory.
2. Ensure the web server can create and write to `assets/json` (the app will create it automatically on first request).
3. Visit `/register.php` to create the first profile—this user is promoted to **admin** so they can delegate settings.
4. Head to `/settings.php` to review configurable options and dataset previews.

## Settings model

Settings are described in `assets/json/dynamic/settings.json` with the following structure:

- `value` – Current value (string or JSON serialised string via the UI).
- `managed_by` – `admins`, `everyone`, `custom`, or `none`.
- `allowed_roles` – For `custom`, a list of roles (e.g. `moderator`) or specific people (`user:3`).
- `category` – The thematic group (branding, privacy, content, collaboration).

Admins can change both the value and the delegation policy for each entry. Non-admins may update a setting only when delegation grants them access.

## Asset configuration & setup

Every PHP, CSS, JSON, JS, XML, and public entry point is catalogued automatically through the asset configuration dataset. Administrators can open `/setup.php` to:

- review the generated defaults (enable/disable flags, mode selectors, and template variants) for each asset;
- assign which roles can personalise an asset and whether members may apply overrides from their own settings page;
- capture global or role-level overrides that cascade to every user; and
- create or clear user-specific values without editing flat files.

Mirrored assets defined in `asset_mirrors.json` surface as read-only cards inside `/setup.php`. Administrators can toggle whether the mirrored copy is published, while the canonical asset retains full override controls for modes and variants.

The setup dashboard mirrors the `assets/php/global` convention by saving each change straight into the flat-file datasets (`asset_configurations.json` and `asset_overrides.json`). As new files are introduced, the manifest is refreshed automatically during bootstrap so the dashboard always reflects the real filesystem.

Members with permission to personalise assets will see an **Asset personalisation** section inside `/settings.php`. The UI surfaces the default, global, and role-derived values alongside the active value for each parameter so users can confidently tune their experience without breaking dependent assets.

## Posting model

Posts are stored with HTML5-friendly bodies plus additional metadata:

- `summary` – Short notification copy used by templates, previews, and cards.
- `tags` – Array of comma-separated labels for filtering or search.
- `attachments` – Metadata for uploaded files living under `/assets/uploads/<extension>`.
- `template` – Selected layout name sourced from `template_options`.
- `format_options` – Rendering hints such as `content_format` (`html`, `xhtml`, `markdown`).
- `display_options` – Flags for showing statistics or embeds on a per-post basis.
- `notification_template` – XML/JSON template key for queued notifications.
- `notification_channels` – Channels requested in addition to admin defaults.
- `variables` – Key/value replacements merged into notification templates.
- `custom_type` – Optional label (e.g. `article`, `event`, `stream`).
- `privacy` – `public`, `connections`, or `private` per entry.
- `collaborators` – Usernames allowed to co-edit an entry.
- `conversation_style` – `standard`, `threaded`, or `broadcast`.
- `likes` – Array of user IDs who liked the post.
- `embeds` – Detected media metadata rendered inline when the rich embed policy allows it.
- `statistics` – Calculated metrics including word, character, heading, and embed counts.

The home feed honours privacy and collaborator rules, and collaborators can open posts in edit mode via `/post.php?post=<id>`.

Rich embeds are generated entirely locally using the templates in `assets/json/static/embed_providers.json`. Administrators can disable inline rendering globally through the **Rich Embed Policy** setting; the metadata is still stored with each post so embeds can reappear instantly when the policy is re-enabled.

Statistics follow the **Post Statistics Visibility** setting. When hidden, the values remain in the dataset for analysis without surfacing in the UI.

## Managing datasets

Administrators can replace the entire contents of `users`, `posts`, or `settings` by pasting JSON into the dataset form on `/settings.php`. The manifest ensures each dataset is routed to the right `static` or `dynamic` store, enabling migrations without SSH access while keeping a clear audit of every dataset’s purpose.

Static mirror mappings live in `asset_mirrors`, giving operators a single place to declare which canonical files should be published into `public/assets/` during bootstrap.

Buttons in the dataset table trigger local AJAX calls to `/dataset.php`, which respects the manifest’s `expose_via_api` flag. Sensitive stores such as `users` remain blocked, while public data (like `html5_elements`) and operational metadata (like `settings`) are available for quick inspection.

The feed and composer use the same client runtime to fetch the HTML5 element reference on demand, provide live previews, and post likes asynchronously without full page reloads. All network calls terminate within the application—no remote APIs are required.

## Notifications and delivery

Filegate keeps notification metadata in flat files so delivery agents can operate without remote APIs.

- `assets/json/static/notification_channels.json` defines the available transports (email, browser push, cookie banner, file-cache) and their capabilities.
- `assets/xml/static/notification_templates.xml` stores channel-specific subjects and bodies; admins may extend it with additional `<template>` nodes.
- `assets/json/dynamic/notifications.json` is the delivery queue written by post creation and updates.
- `assets/uploads/<extension>` holds binary attachments that can be referenced inside notification payloads.

The **Default Notification Channels** and **Notification Cache Driver** settings in `/settings.php` decide which transports are queued automatically and whether file-based caching is active. For Apache hosts you can add caching or cookie headers via `.htaccess`; for Nginx, mirror those directives inside your server block (e.g. caching `/assets/uploads/` and exposing the `media.php` download endpoint).

A local service worker or CRON job can inspect `notifications.json` and the per-channel cache files generated under `/assets/uploads/file-cache/` to send emails or push payloads using platform-specific tooling.

## Development

Start a local PHP server from the project root:

```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t public
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Flat-file datasets are created automatically under `assets/json` once the app receives traffic.

## Testing

Run a syntax check over every PHP file:

```bash
find assets public -name '*.php' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 php -l
```
